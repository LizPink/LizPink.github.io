[{"content":"So far, it\u0026rsquo;s time to establish my English channel! To date I decide to only upload some study report, usually very neat. So let\u0026rsquo;s begin!\nIn the past three months, I actually have studies a lot of stuff, thanks to the fact that there is only 2 credits chosen this semester. So in general, I learned Some courses :\n1. Crash Course on Computer Science\nReference:\nhttps://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1EW411u7th?p=1\u0026vd_source=eb54fab8ff9874cf7378b4cfd5ece052\nTime line:\nStrat Date: 2024/09 End Date: 2024/09 Review:\nThis course is about 40+ Hours but cover a large variety of topics (almost all!) in computer science, including the history of primitive computing machines and modern computers; the hardware, form vacuum tubes to semiconductors, and software of computer; the major disciplines of computer science, such as complexity, database, net, cryptology, computer version, graphics and so on. Though I didn\u0026rsquo;t fully understanding every episode it offered, this give a comprehensive understanding of what computer science is and how it studies.\n2.Information Theory and Entropy\nReference:\nInformation and Entropy | Information and Entropy | Electrical Engineering and Computer Science | MIT OpenCourseWare\nTime Line:\nStart: 2024/09 Pause:2024/10, finished 5 chapters/ 9 chapters. Review:\nI finished the first four chapters on the theorems of information, encoding, compression, error correction and probability. However, because this course was uploaded a very long time ago(about nearly 10 years!), the quality of the video isn\u0026rsquo;t very clear, and there is no blogs communicating on this course, so I often felt helpless when I encounter some puzzles. But I still think this course is worth learning.\n3. Missing Semester on your Computer Science Education\nReference:\nMIT - the missing semester of your cs education (missing-semester-cn.github.io)\n[Bash引用手册] Quoting (Bash Reference Manual) (gnu.org)\nTime line:\nStart Date:2024/10 Pause: From 2024/10, because it is too hard and require many pre-knowledge. Review:\nThis course mainly focuses on some useful tools based on command lines, most of which rely on a language like Unix or Bash(I don\u0026rsquo;t have many knowledge in this terminology). I think this course is worth studying because you will encounter many situations where dealing with command lines is a mandatory. For example, I use Hugo to update my personal site, and it requires some command language just like Bash I learned in this course. However, this course requires much pre-knowledge than I expected, so I stop learning after two or three lectures. Maybe I will continue later in this year?\n4. Mathematics for Computer Science\nReference:\nCourse | 6.042J | 2019 Fall | MIT Open Learning Library\n【麻省理工-离散数学 | 2010 Fall】（中英字幕）_哔哩哔哩_bilibili\n5.From Nand to Tetris\nReference:\nCoursera | Online Courses From Top Universities.
