[{"content":"[Update] This is the week between 11/25-12/1.\nAt Tuesday, I finished Module5 of the Course. And I\u0026rsquo;m decide to keep this trend to finish this course within this week.\nAt Wednesday, I do finish this course PART I as mentioned.\nI decide that I skip the exercises of LADR and just focus on reading the main chapters of this book from Chapter5 Section 5B, since I feel like needing time to digest and convince myself about these theorems.\n[Online Course] 1.

Review:\nThis course mainly focuses on some useful tools based on command lines, most of which rely on a language like Unix or Bash(I don\u0026rsquo;t have many knowledge in this terminology). I think this course is worth studying because you will encounter many situations where dealing with command lines is a mandatory. For example, I use Hugo to update my personal site, and it requires some command language just like Bash I learned in this course. However, this course requires much pre-knowledge than I expected, so I stop learning after two or three lectures. Maybe I will continue later in this year?\n4.

To be precise, I read some books about logic and axiomatic set theory, e.g. Jech. Then I placed and simplified some of the knowledge to form a practical system for me to master in a markdown file. The process has lasted for about 4-5 days, i.e. I start from Tuesday to Saturday. I barely do other things during this time.\n[Online Course] 1.
